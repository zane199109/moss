# Moss

**English** | [中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

Moss turns Monad protocol interactions into Agent-callable Capabilities through `discover → load → action → simulate`. It builds and verifies unsigned transactions; it never signs or sends them.

> [!WARNING]
> Moss is unaudited alpha software. Do not use it with production funds.

## Why Moss

- **Agents call Protocol-owned operations.** Protocol packages own addresses, ABIs, calldata construction, parameter rules, and Receipt parsing.
- **Simulation produces evidence.** Each successful transaction yields ordered raw Changes and a structured Receipt that must cover every Change exactly once and in order.
- **Signing stays separate.** MCP Agents compare every ordered Receipt text with the user's request; SDK consumers may use structured Outcomes before a wallet sees the unsigned transactions.

## Supported Protocols

Moss currently targets Monad mainnet, chain ID `143`.

| Protocol | Package | Capabilities | Queries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WMON | `@themoss/system` | `wrap`, `unwrap` | `balanceOf` |
| ERC-20 and native MON | `@themoss/erc` | `transfer`, `approve` | `balanceOf`, `allowance`, `metadata` |
| ERC-721 | `@themoss/erc` | `transfer` | `ownerOf`, `balanceOf` |
| ERC-1155 | `@themoss/erc` | `transfer`, `approve` | `balanceOf`, `uri`, `isApprovedForAll` |
| Kuru | `@themoss/protocol-kuru` | `swap` | `quote` |
| PancakeSwap V2 / V3 | `@themoss/protocol-pancakeswap` | `swap` | `quote` |

ERC-1155 `transfer` accepts a collection, token ID, amount, and recipient. Token IDs and amounts are base-10 uint256 strings, including zero. The Capability builds one `safeTransferFrom`; batch transfer construction is not currently exposed. Receipts still decode both `TransferSingle` and `TransferBatch` Changes without aggregating or reordering their items.

## Quickstart

Requires Node 22 or newer and pnpm 11. The examples use live Monad state but need no key or funded account because Moss only simulates.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nishuzumi/moss
cd moss
pnpm install
pnpm build

# discover → load → action → simulate a WMON wrap
pnpm --filter @themoss/example-simple-flow wrap

# quote and simulate a Kuru MON → USDC swap
pnpm --filter @themoss/example-simple-flow swap

# after exporting MONADSCAN_API_KEY, fetch a verified full ABI (ADR 0007)
pnpm fetch-abi 0x1b81D678ffb9C0263b24A97847620C99d213eB14 swapRouter02
```

Run the test suite without live RPC calls:

```bash
pnpm test:offline
```

The full tutorial is [Getting started](./docs/getting-started.md). It opens every stage, configures MCP, and finishes by creating a Protocol package.

### Use as an MCP server

Build the repo, then add the stdio server to an MCP client:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "moss": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["<path-to-moss>/packages/mcp-server/dist/cli.js"],
      "env": { "MOSS_RPC_URL": "https://rpc.monad.xyz" }
    }
  }
}
```

The server exposes exactly `discover`, `load`, `action`, and `simulate`. See [MCP tool contracts](./docs/mcp-tools.md).

### Use as a library

```ts
import { NATIVE, Registry } from "@themoss/core";
import * as erc from "@themoss/erc";
import * as kuru from "@themoss/protocol-kuru";
import { createTraceSimulator } from "@themoss/simulator";
import * as system from "@themoss/system";
import { monadRuntime, USDC_ADDRESS } from "@themoss/system";

const runtime = await monadRuntime();
const registry = new Registry(runtime).use(system, erc, kuru);
const account = "0xcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc";
const simulator = createTraceSimulator(runtime, {
  receipt: (capability, changes) => registry.parseReceipt(capability, changes),
});

const result = await registry.action("kuru", "swap", account, {
  tokenIn: NATIVE,
  tokenOut: USDC_ADDRESS,
  amountIn: "1",
  slippage: 50,
});
if (result.kind !== "capability") throw new Error("expected a Capability");

const simulation = await simulator.simulate(result);
if (simulation.halted || simulation.results.some((item) => item.warnings.length)) {
  throw new Error("simulation failed; do not sign");
}
```

## How verification works

Every Capability owns one direct unsigned transaction and one typed Receipt parser registered for its `protocol + method`. The serialized tree does not carry a caller-supplied Receipt name. Additional transactions belong to nested Capabilities, which core validates and flattens in deterministic depth-first order.

Simulation records successful Events and native MON transfers as immutable Changes in exact execution order. Receipt leaves must retain the original Change objects with identical length and order.

Any revert, trace failure, Receipt failure, or coverage mismatch is a terminal Warning. The library exposes complete Receipt trees and structured Outcomes; MCP returns only their verified ordered leaf texts and Warnings to Agents.

## Repository layout

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `@themoss/core` | Decorators, Registry, parameter contracts, Capability trees, Receipt validation |
| `@themoss/simulator` | `debug_traceCall`, state chaining, ordered Change extraction |
| `@themoss/erc` | Address-free ERC Protocols, ABIs, and Receipt semantics |
| `@themoss/system` | Monad Runtime, official constants, and system Protocols |
| `@themoss/protocol-*` | Protocol-specific ABIs, Capabilities, Queries, and Receipts |
| `@themoss/mcp-server` | MCP transport and application composition |

## Development

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```

Build must precede typecheck because workspace packages resolve generated declarations. Use `pnpm test:offline` when offline.
